Our large mountain home has all modern comforts and is ideal for
families, the main living area being open with an american kitchen,
large dining area and living room with home cinema, stereo and a
wood-pellet stove. The dining area has huge patio doors with a
stunning view over the mountains, opening out onto our large terrace
with gas bbq, hammock, and dining area with awning. There is also a
bathroom and bedroom on this floor.

The basement is 900 sq. ft (85m2) and has our spare bedroom, workshop,
laundry and large storage space for skis etc.

Our big garden (half an acre or 2300m2) opens out on two sides onto
fields and forest, with a view across the forest to the Grand Colon
mountain, part of the Belledonne mountain range. We've got plenty of
toys and board games, bicycles that you can use, plus ping-pong table,
large garden chalet which is a children's play-house / sleeping area
in the summer.

We have a cleaning lady who knows the house well and will come to
welcome you, and who can also clean the house for you if desired.

exchanges.
