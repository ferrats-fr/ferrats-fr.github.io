Cap Corse is one of the most 
unspoiled regions of the whole Isle of Beauty.

Corsica is “a Mountain in the Sea”. Of anywhere in Corsica,
it’s Cap Corse in the extreme north of the island that merits the
name. This peninsula is 40km long and 15km wide. In the middle runs a
ridge, with Mont Stello rising to 1307m. 

There are 25 beaches in Cap Corse, the sandy beaches being
concentrated on the east coast near our house (Pietracorbara, Cagnano,
Tamarone) and to the north (Barcaghju).

In the house is a detailed booklet of all our favourite places in Cap
Corsica - beaches, walks, restaurants, shops and more, with
information on all the below activities... if you will be coming to
Casa Albore then we can send you an electronic copy of our booklet to
help you start planning your stay...
